Be aware of cyclists and other vehicles, follow the rules of the road, check blind spots before changing lanes or making turns, and avoid changing lanes in the middle of intersections during the G test and must follow instructions by [driving instructor mississauga](https://thedrivingtutors.com/drive-test-mississauga/). Park on the designated side and you'll pass the test, good luck!
